# Language-Translator

Language Translator is a Web App that takes in input text of any language format and converts it into another language <br>
Inspiration to this came from a friend trying to learn a new language in college and difficulty in access available materials to learn a new language easily. This immediately struck in the idea into me to create something from the Frontend aspect of it
